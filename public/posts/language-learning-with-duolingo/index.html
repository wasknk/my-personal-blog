For an intermediate learner, Duolingo can be great for discovering cultural nuances and everyday phrases that you might miss in a textbook. However, for a brand new language, I feel it&rsquo;s not as efficient. It’s like expecting a baby who isn&rsquo;t ready to speak to immediately read books full of complex characters. The platform doesn&rsquo;t provide enough information in terms of quantity and variety to build a foundational understanding of the language.">

<p>For adult learners, I believe it&rsquo;s essential to follow a textbook or work with a teacher to first establish the basic grammatical structure and core concepts of a language.</p>
