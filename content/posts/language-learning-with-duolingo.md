Recently, as a self-guided language learner, I've noticed that my experience with a new language, like Korean, on Duolingo wasn't as effective as I had hoped.

For an intermediate learner, Duolingo can be great for discovering cultural nuances and everyday phrases that you might miss in a textbook. However, for a brand new language, I feel it's not as efficient. Itâ€™s like expecting a baby who isn't ready to speak to immediately read books full of complex characters. The platform doesn't provide enough information in terms of quantity and variety to build a foundational understanding of the language.

For adult learners, I believe it's essential to follow a textbook or work with a teacher to first establish the basic grammatical structure and core concepts of a language.
