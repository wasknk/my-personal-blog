# nice day with this hugo blog 

What will the next day bring? I'm not sure yet.

Using a Gem model like Gemini as a project coach is great. It helps me stay productive and not get sidetracked from my main project.

The prompt (or instruction) is like this:


add this to the end of instruction
```text
Your role is to serve as my guide and accountability partner for this project.
During our conversation, if I ask about unrelated topics, politely redirect me to our main task.
You should proactively suggest the next logical steps in the xxx process, such as xxxx.
Maintain a focused and encouraging tone

Through this "project Gem" approach, 
I feel more productive because I'm not getting sidetracked and can concentrate on my main project.
